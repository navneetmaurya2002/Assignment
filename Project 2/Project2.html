<hr>
<p><b>Coffee</b> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean#Coffee_plant" title="know more">Coffea</a></em> species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specially having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Reunion in the Indian Ocean. Dried coffee seeds (referred ti as <q>beans</q>) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee. </p>

<h3 id="Roast">Roasting</h3>
<p>
	Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions, such as infusions from green coffee beans, coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted. The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing  the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean dexreases in weight as mosture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.
	<br>
	<br>
	The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the bean reaches approximately 200<sup>o</sup>C (392<sup>o</sup>F), though different varieties of seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates. During roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down starches, changing them to simple sugars that begin to brown, which alters the clolr of the bean.

<h3 id="Storage">Storage</h3>
<p>
	Coffee is best stored in an airlight container made of ceramic, glass or non-reactive metal. Higher quality pre-packaged coffee usually has a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to realease gases. Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved when it is stored away from moisture, heat, and light.
	<br>
	The ability of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means that it should be kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee in refrigerator is not recommended due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat the interior of an home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.
