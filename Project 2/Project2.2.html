<h1>Coffee</h1>
<hr>
<p><b>Coffee</b> is a brewed drink prepared from reasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain
	 <em>Coffea</em> species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specially having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) 
	 and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Reunion in the Indian Ocean. Dried coffee 
	 seeds (referred ti as <q>beans</q>) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. 
	 Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee. </p>
