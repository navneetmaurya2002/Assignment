          <h4>The World's most famous equation, but what does it really mean? "Energy equals mass times the speed of ligt squared".
               On the most basic level, the equation says that energy and mass (matter) are interchangeable; they 
            are different forms of the same thing.</h4>

                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>
                        He never failed math. This is popular "fact" promoted on the internet, maybe in an attempt to relate to
                        genius.However, it is simply not true. Overall, Einstein was an average student, but math was one area where he excelled, unsurprisingly.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Einstein encouraged the development of the nuclear bomb. His involvement is often misinterpreted, with some 
                        claiming that he helped create the atom bomb. In reality, what he did was write a letter ot President FDR
                        encouraging him to begin work on such a weapon, which led to the Manhattan Project.
                        Although a dedicated pacifist and, later, an anti-nuke spokesman, Einstein was convinced that America needed the atomic bomb before
                        the Nazis.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        He was a great musician. If the whole "genius" thing didn't work out, Einstein could have become a violinist.
                        His mother palyed piano so he had the love of music instilled in him -- via violin lessons -- at the young age of five. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        He married his cousin. After Einstein divorced his first wife, Mileva Maric, he married his cusin, Elsa Lowenthal.
                        He was, actually, quite a bad husband to his first wife in their late years. He had affairs he never tried to hide, he moved the entire family to
                        Berlin without discussion, and treated her more as a servant than a wife. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        He won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics. This alon eisn't particularly surprising. What is surprising is the fact that he didn't receive it for the general
                        or special theory of relativity, but rather for the photelectric effect.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        He loved to sail. Ever since university, Einstein sailed as a hobby. But by his own admission, he never made a particularly good sailor. 
                    In fact, he didn't even know how to swim.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        He really didn't like socks, and usually didn't wear them. In fact in a letter to Elsa, he bragged about getting away "without wearing socks" while at Oxford. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        He had an illegitmate daughter. This wasn't know until the 1980s, but according to correspondence between Albert and Mileva it was determined that the two had a daughter in 1902 called Lieseri.
                        At one point, all mention of her in letters stopped so her fate is unknown.
